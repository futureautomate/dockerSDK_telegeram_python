##Overview

Containerization has revolutionized software deployment and management, and in this tutorial, we demonstrate how to leverage the Telegram Python module and the Docker SDK to control Docker containers programmatically. By integrating the Telegram platform with Docker, you can automate container operations, monitor containers, and interact with them using a chatbot interface.
Contents

The repository includes the following files:

    1. Python script demonstrating the integration of the Telegram Python module and Docker SDK to control Docker containers. This script provides examples of retrieving container lists, stopping all containers, and running new containers with custom parameters.
    2. Tokey script to add the api token provided by botfather
    3. README.md: This README file providing an overview of the repository and the video tutorial.

##Getting Started

To get started with the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
    Install Docker SDK and Python Telegram Library (Checked the Docker SDK and Telegram Series for more idea)


    Obtain a Telegram bot API token by following the instructions in the video tutorial.
    Replace the placeholder values in the token script with your own API token and desired Docker configuration.
    Run the script

##Applications

The integration of the Telegram Python module and Docker SDK opens up various applications, including:

    Remote container management: Control Docker containers from anywhere by sending commands via the Telegram chatbot.
    Automation of container operations: Build scripts or bots that automatically start, stop, or restart containers based on specific events or triggers.
    Deployment orchestration: Initiate deployments, spin up new containers, and manage container clusters through Telegram messages.
    Monitoring and notifications: Receive real-time updates on container status, resource usage, and error alerts via Telegram, enabling prompt response to issues.
    Interactive container management: Provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with Docker containers through a Telegram chatbot.
